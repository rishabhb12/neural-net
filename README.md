# neural-net
Problem Definition
The goal of this assignment is train two data sets. The first is a linear data set and the second is non-linear. We are supposed to train a neural net model on these data sets in order to classify the data itself. The neural network is composed of one input layer, one hidden layer with a modifiable number of neurons, and an output layer. The tan activation function is used in combination with forward and backpropagation to train the network. The result is useful because it will result in an accurate neural network, capable of processing and classifying linear and non-linear data. The primary issue that could be run into for this neural network is the learning rate resulting in a divergence and never converging properly with the gradient descenet utilizing the cross-entropy error function. However this is circumvented through changing the learning rate to see which one works best.
